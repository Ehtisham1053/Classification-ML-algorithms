# Classification Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Classification Model**, demonstrating various classification techniques in machine learning. Classification is a fundamental supervised learning task where the goal is to predict categorical labels based on input features. The models implemented in this repository provide insights into different methodologies used for classification problems.

## What is Classification?
Classification is a type of supervised learning where an algorithm is trained on labeled data and then used to predict discrete labels for new data points. Common applications of classification include:
- Spam detection in emails
- Sentiment analysis
- Medical diagnosis
- Image recognition
- Fraud detection

## Classification Techniques
Several techniques can be used to perform classification, including:

### 1. **Logistic Regression**
   - A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model binary dependent variables.
   - Works well for linearly separable data.

### 2. **Decision Trees**
   - A tree-like model that makes decisions by splitting data based on feature values.
   - Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.

### 3. **Random Forest**
   - An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
   - Suitable for handling large datasets with complex relationships.

### 4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
   - Works well for high-dimensional data.

### 5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A non-parametric algorithm that classifies based on the majority class of the k-nearest neighbors.
   - Effective for small datasets but computationally expensive for large datasets.

### 6. **Na√Øve Bayes**
   - A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of feature independence.
   - Commonly used in text classification.

### 7. **Neural Networks**
   - A deep learning approach that uses layers of neurons to learn complex patterns.
   - Effective for image, speech, and text classification tasks.

## Explanation of Classification Models
Each classification model has unique advantages and limitations. The choice of model depends on factors such as:
- **Dataset size and complexity**
- **Interpretability requirements**
- **Computational resources**
- **Need for feature engineering**

This repository provides implementations of multiple classification models, along with comparisons of their performance using different evaluation metrics.

## Implementation Details
